Because it could be a reply message you have requested from a significant time ago and as it stands right now is going to get appended to the message list model . So the messages between that reply and what's already in the model will never get loaded. You may have already thought about this though?\n\nI'm currently getting unit testing setup and running and then i can finish the new message list model, which should handle all these edge cases. It was turning out to be rather complex, so i can't finish it without tests \ud83d\ude0a"}}, "media_album_id": "0", "can_be_deleted_for_all_users": false, "edit_date": 1549975514, "contains_unread_mention": false, "chat_id": -209613759, "via_bot_user_id": 0, "sender_user_id": 53248761, "can_be_edited": false, "views": 0, "id": 232292089856, "is_outgoing": true, "can_be_deleted_only_for_self": true, "ttl": 0, "can_be_forwarded": true}
